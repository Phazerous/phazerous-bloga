### Journey to FullStack Web Development:

My journey into FullStack Web Development began with a passion for creating complete projects from scratch. This independence and the ability to handle all aspects of a project appealed to me. I started in a role far removed from programming – as a manual tester – but used this time to dive deep into learning. My drive led me from basic testing to mastering Next.js and Nest.js, driven by their unified use of JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Career Highlights:

A significant milestone in my career was transitioning from a manual tester to a FullStack Web Programmer within a year. This progression was fueled by my dedication to self-study, where I utilized resources like Udemy courses, technical documentation, and YouTube tutorials. Alongside this, I developed expertise in Google Sheets and Google Apps Script, becoming the go-to person in my company for these tools.

### Educational Background:

My education has been a mix of formal and informal learning. I've immersed myself in books about React, completed numerous online courses, and engaged in hands-on project development. This blend of theoretical and practical learning has been the cornerstone of my growth in web development.

### Personal Interests:

Programming is more than a job for me; it's a hobby and a passion. I'm continually open to learning new things, with a current focus on artificial intelligence. My interest in AI, particularly ChatGPT, is shaping my current projects, and I'm excited about integrating these technologies into my work.

### Blog Purpose:

My blog is a personal journey diary and a professional development tracker. It's a platform for me to document my growth into a senior developer and team lead. While initially for self-reflection, I aim to transform it into a valuable resource for others. Through sharing lessons learned and solutions found, I hope to inspire and assist others in their development journeys.

### Personal Philosophy:

I am driven by a love for working, learning, and achieving. My philosophy is centered around constant growth and result-oriented work. This blog reflects that ethos, showcasing my journey and the relentless pursuit of excellence in web development.
