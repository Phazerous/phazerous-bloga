## Learning GitHub Actions for CI-CD
Want to share with you my recent experience in diving into the world of CI-CD, specifically through using GitHub Actions. It's been quite a journey, and I've learned a lot along the way.

Yesterday, I decided to transition from my usual manual deployment processes, like using FTP clients, to something more automated. I've always done things manually, so this was a new challenge for me. I started exploring GitHub Actions for automating testing and deploying on the server.

At first, it seemed daunting. But I soon realized that GitHub Actions aren't as complicated as they appear. The key is just to provide clear instructions for the actions to execute. It's more about understanding the process than the complexity of the task.

However, this didn't come without its challenges. I ran into several issues, especially with deployment using GitHub Actions. Let me walk you through some of these:

One of the first problems I encountered was on my self-hosted Windows machine. The tools I was using couldn't create an SSH folder due to the absence of certain syntax, like the tilde sign.

Another hurdle was figuring out SSH keys. I had never worked with them before, so I was initially confused about which key to use – the public or the **private** one.

After about three hours of persistence, searching on Stack Overflow, and consulting with ChatGPT, I finally cracked it. The issue was with the key – I needed to use the private key, not the public one. And voilà, it worked!

This experience reinforced a crucial lesson for me – the importance of persistence. It's a principle I follow not just in programming but in life as well. As Napoleon Hill said, "Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success."

## Discovering a New Blog Template: [Tailwind NextJS Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

Another exciting discovery from my journey in web development! Today, I stumbled upon something fascinating that's going to change the way I work on my blog.

After writing about Nextra and its templates yesterday, I've found another template that's even more suited to my needs. This new find is a game changer for my blog's development.

#### Why It's Better
What makes this new template stand out is its configurability. Unlike the previous one, this template allows for more customization in terms of structure and components. It's just better designed and more flexible, giving me the freedom to shape my blog exactly how I envision it.

The best part? If I decide to create something entirely on my own, this template provides a solid foundation to start from. It eliminates dependency on predefined structures, allowing me to craft whatever I want. It's the perfect blend of structure and freedom.

While I'm considering building my own blog website template in the future, for now, this solution is just what I needed. It's packed with all the features I require.

## Venturing into ChatGPT and AI Automation at Work

I delved into something quite revolutionary that might just transform how we operate at my company. I'm talking about ChatGPT, OpenAI's model, and the incredible potential it holds for automating tasks and boosting productivity.

At work, we constantly look for ways to enhance efficiency and solve problems for our team and customers. The idea that struck me was to leverage AI, specifically ChatGPT, to automate some of these tasks. It seemed like a daunting task initially, but the journey was eye-opening.

One key discovery by the day's end was something called 'fine-tuning', as described in the ChatGPT documentation. This concept is about customizing the AI model to better suit specific needs. I even found some helpful links in the documentation that clarified how this works.

Currently, I'm laying the groundwork for testing the ChatGPT API with real examples. The process is surprisingly straightforward. You create a dataset of prompts and corresponding answers and then feed this into the ChatGPT API. This allows the AI to learn from your specific inputs, adapting to your needs.

What I initially thought would be a complex task turned out to be quite manageable. The AI learns from the data you provide, making the whole process of training and implementation seem much less intimidating than I first imagined.

This discovery has me excited about the future. I'm looking forward to applying this technology in practical scenarios at work, potentially revolutionizing how we approach problem-solving and task automation.

## Knives Out

I took a delightful dive back into the world of mystery and intrigue by re-watching [«Knives Out»](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8946378/). It's been a while since I first saw it in 2019, and I must say, it's still as captivating as ever.

"Knives Out" is one of those rare films that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Despite having seen it before, the twists and turns felt fresh, and the storytelling was as gripping as I remembered. I've always had a soft spot for detective movies, and this one tops my list with its excellent storyline and unexpected turns.

It's as great as movie as:

- [Murder on the Orient Express (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3402236/)

- [Death on the Nile (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7657566/)

- [A Haunting in Venice (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22687790/)
