## Vercel & templates

Today, I devoted my time to learning about Vercel and exploring its platform. I discovered several ready-made templates
that can be utilized to enhance my skills. These templates, available as common repositories on GitHub, include actual
code rather than just documentation, making them easy to replicate.

## Nextra

I noticed that many websites use Nextra, a convenient tool for managing MDX and MD files. It automates processes,
allowing for straightforward usage without the need for additional coding. Custom JavaScript can also be easily
integrated into it. Nextra offers two themes: a documentation theme and a blogging theme. Currently, I'm using the
blogging
theme, which greatly simplifies my work, especially for blog-related projects. No need of creating my own from scratch.

## Vercel's Products

This exploration marks a new phase in my experience with Vercel and Nextra. Additionally, I've started incorporating
Tailwind CSS into my projects due to its simplicity and high recommendations. I have started to love all the Vercel's
products, because they're modern, easy to use, and well-documented.

## Deploying and configuring a website

Moreover, I learned about DNS and its key attributes like A and CNAME records, essential for server location. Finally, I
launched a website using Vercel and DNS settings. While the process wasn't difficult, I realized the importance of these
tools for my work. This whole experience has been enlightening, furthering my understanding of these resources.
